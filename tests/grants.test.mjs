/* What each role can reach, enumerated rather than sampled.
 *
 * Every other test in this suite asks "can anon do this particular thing?" — and every hole
 * this branch has shipped was a thing nobody thought to ask about: the fuzz_point RPC, then
 * UPDATE and DELETE through the view, then TRUNCATE on audit. All three were created by the
 * same Supabase default privilege (`alter default privileges in schema public grant all ...
 * to anon, authenticated`), and all three were invisible to a test that checks a list.
 *
 * So this file inverts the question: list everything anon can reach and assert the list is
 * exactly one entry. A new table, view, sequence or function that arrives with the default
 * grant attached fails here on the next run, whether or not anyone thought to test it.
