// tests/listener-open-world.test.mjs — open world is how you listen; a park is how you author.
/* Kerem, 2026-09-21: "I think it will be best structural mode. How can we manage it inbetween
   setters and listeners? Should we leave totaly the park view of listeners?" — and then chose
   to. The reason is not performance: both modes were measured at the same cost (2 voices, 2
   stretch worklets, 16.7ms median frame, in both). It is that a listener walking a city does
   not know where a park boundary is, and place mode snaps them onto a route line they are not
   standing on. Open world's model — nearest route lends its patch, distance sets the level — is
   the truthful one for someone outdoors.

   A listener already gets routes instead of parks in the picker (renderPlaceList), so the only
   thing that could drop them into a park view was the switch itself. */
