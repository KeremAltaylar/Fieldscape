// tests/audio-memory.test.mjs — what a voice holds, and what an unreachable archive says.
/* Kerem, 2026-09-21, walking Koşuyolu on his phone as a listener: "the sound ... was clipping and
   lagging", and after a refresh "routes and points were gone although I didn't publish anything".
   Measured causes, not guesses:
   - each soundscape voice decoded the same recording TWICE — once for the stretch worklet and once
     for a dry fallback player that only ever sounds if the worklet fails. 146 MB per copy for his
     6m40s stereo recording, so ~292 MB per point; two points in range put the tab near 300 MB and a
     phone stalls its audio thread long before that. Heap measured 185-200 MB before, 28-39 MB after.
   - nothing was lost: a listener holds nothing locally, so a failed read left an empty map under the
     words "Nothing published here yet", which is a different sentence from the truth. */
