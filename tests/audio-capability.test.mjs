// tests/audio-capability.test.mjs — deciding audio quality by measuring the device, not guessing.
/* Kerem, 2026-09-22, on his own iPhone: "sound is still bad when I open the sound." smallDevice()
   guessed "phone" from screen size and deviceMemory, and guessed wrong: 390px and a coarse
   pointer read as small while the full route stack cost that phone 9.7% of one core — four times
   the headroom the dev desktop needed to run the same stack at 70.6% (task-8-brief.md). richAudio()
   replaces the guess with a measurement: render a short offline copy of the full stack and time
   it, the same method diag.html section 5 already proved, and take the cheap path only when a
   device genuinely cannot keep up in real time.

   This file covers richAudioVerdict/saneCapabilityPct as the pure functions they were written to
   be, the caching and fallback behaviour of richAudio()/primeAudioCapability() around them, the
   bedStart ordering that keeps the first walk of a session from racing the probe, and that
   diag.html surfaces what index.html actually decided. tests/android-audio.test.mjs and
   tests/mobile-budget.test.mjs cover the four call sites (makeRoom, makeWarp, buildFxChain,
   voiceBudget) themselves. */

   The probe answers "can this device render the stack in less than real time", and Kerem's
   iPhone can: 9.7% of a core. It still ticks on a walk. Safari hands every device a 128-sample
   callback whatever latencyHint it is given (measured on his phone: interactive, balanced,
   playback, 0.05 and 0.2 all return 2.7 ms), so a stack that is cheap on average can still
   overrun the callback where four convolvers land. Average headroom is not peak headroom, and
   no offline render measures the difference — only the same walk, one flag apart, does. */
